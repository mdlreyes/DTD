<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This code measures the delay-time distribution of Type Ia SNe in individual dwarf galaxies using stellar abundance measurements. The required data are: 
* the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a galaxy
* the fraction R = (iron from Type Ia SNe)/(iron from core-collapse SNe), which can be measured from the [alpha/Fe] abundance (see [Kirby et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...881...45K/abstract))
